Software II - Advanced Java Concepts â€“ C195

Task 1: Java Application Development

You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a GUI-based scheduling desktop application.
The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices
in Phoenix, Arizona; White Plains, New York; Montreal, Canada; and London, England. The consulting organization has
provided a MySQL database that the application must pull data from. The database is used for other systems, so its
structure cannot be modified. The organization outlined specific business requirements that must be met as part of the
application.

useful for the company in determining which of their locations is the most successful.
